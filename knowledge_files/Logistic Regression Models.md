Model Setup: First, you define the model to accept certain inputs (like pixels of images).
Initialize Parameters: Set starting values for calculations (weights and biases).
Iterative Process:
Forward Propagation: Use the inputs and current parameters (weights and biases) to calculate predictions using the sigmoid function. This determines how likely it is that an image is a cat.
Calculate Loss: Determine how off the predictions are from the actual results (whether the images are truly of cats or not).
Backward Propagation: Adjust the parameters based on how far off the predictions were (trying to reduce errors).
Update Parameters: Refine the parameters to improve predictions in the next round.
Repeat: This process repeats, refining the predictions until the model is as accurate as possible.
This logistic regression model, although simple, is a basic form of a neural network because it processes inputs through layers of calculations to arrive at a decision, much like how our brains process information.
