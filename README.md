Welcome to **neurons.me**, a modular framework for creating robust, decentralized networks of smart nodes, or "neurons". 
This package enables the building of complex distributed systems.

## Introduction to Neurons.me

With `neurons.me`, you can craft and govern artificial neurons, neural networks, and layers in JavaScript. Customize neurons with bespoke weights, biases, and activation functions; organize them into layers; and orchestrate these layers into comprehensive neural networks.

### Installing
To install neurons.me, use the following command:

```bash
npm i neurons.me
```

### Using Neurons.me
To use neurons.me in your project, you first need to require the module:
```js
const neurons = require('neurons.me');
```
I highly recommend you `npm i this.me`.

[this.me](https://www.npmjs.com/package/this.me)

Redefining the web paradigm, THIS.ME centralizes the user. Cryptographic proofs replace conventional databases, pivoting towards a user-centric approach.

Transition into this approach demands a fresh mindset in terms of development, deployment, and education

# Neural Network Creation with neurons.me ðŸ’ªðŸ§ ðŸš€
This README provides a demonstration of how to use the neurons.me library to **create a neural network with 10 layers, each containing 10 neurons.** We'll define the neurons with specific **weights, biases, and activation functions.**

This code will print details of each neuron, layer, and the entire neural network to the console. It will provide insights into the structure and components of the neural network, including neurons' weights, biases, activation functions, and any other properties defined in your `Neuron` class.

Remember to ensure that all the classes and functions (`Neuron`, `Layer`, `createNeuron`, etc.) are correctly implemented and imported in line with the usage in this code snippet.

## Setup
Ensure that the neurons.me library is installed in your project by running the following command:
```js
npm i neurons.me
```
```js
//demo.js
const { Neuron, Layer, createNeuron } = require('neurons.me');

let neuronOptions = {
  weights: [0.5, 0.3, 0.2], // Example weights
  bias: 0.1,
  activationFunction: x => x * 2, // Example activation function
};

let layers = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  let layer = new Layer();
  for (let j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
    let neuron = createNeuron({ options: neuronOptions });
    layer.addNeurons(neuron);
    console.log(`Neuron ${j} in Layer ${i}: `, neuron); // Log each neuron
  }
  layers.push(layer);
}

const NeuralNetwork = require('neurons.me/src/NeuralNetworkClass');
let neuralNetwork = new NeuralNetwork();
layers.forEach(layer => neuralNetwork.addLayer(layer));

console.log("Neural Network Structure: ", neuralNetwork); // Log the entire neural network

// Optionally, log individual layers and neurons
neuralNetwork.layers.forEach((layer, index) => {
  console.log(`Layer ${index}:`, layer);
  layer.neurons.forEach((neuron, neuronIndex) => {
    console.log(`  Neuron ${neuronIndex}:`, neuron);
  });
});

```

## Description
- `neuronOptions`: Specifies the properties of the neurons, such as weights, bias, and activation function.
- The outer loop iterates over the layers, creating a new layer at each iteration.
- The inner loop iterates over the neurons within a layer, creating and adding them to the current layer.
- The neural network is constructed by adding each layer.

The console logs will provide details of each neuron, layer, and the entire neural network.

That's it! Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific requirements, such as changing the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, or the properties of the neurons.

## Approach:
- The neurons.me library provides classes for creating neurons, layers, and neural networks in Node.js.
- Neurons are created using the `createNeuron` function provided by the library. You can create neurons with different options such as custom weights, bias, activation function, or even load pre-defined modules.
- Layers are created using the `Layer` class. A layer holds a collection of neurons.
- Neural networks are created using the `NeuralNetwork` class. A neural network consists of one or more layers.

## Usage:

1. Import the `neurons.me` library: 
   ```js
   let neurons = require('neurons.me');
   ```

2. Create neurons using `new neurons.createNeuron()`. You can pass options such as `load` (for pre-defined modules) or `options` (for custom options).

3. Create a layer using 

   ```js
   new neurons.Layer(). 
   ```

   A layer can hold multiple neurons.

4. Add neurons to the layer using the `addNeuron` method of the layer.

5. Create a neural network using 

6. ```js
   new neurons.NeuralNetwork().
   ```

7. Add layers to the neural network using the `addLayer` method of the neural network.

## Key Points:
- Neurons are created individually using `new neurons.createNeuron()` and can have different options or configurations.
- Layers are created using `new neurons.Layer()`, and each layer can hold multiple neurons.
- Neural networks are created using `new neurons.NeuralNetwork()`, and you can add layers to the neural network using the `addLayer` method.
- When adding layers to a neural network, they are added in the order they are created. The order of the layers in the neural network matters, as it determines the flow of information through the network during forward and backward propagation.

Key Takeaways:

- The `neurons.me` library provides a modular approach to building neural networks, allowing you to create and configure neurons, layers, and neural networks separately.
- By organizing neurons into layers and adding layers to a neural network, you can create complex network architectures.
- Keep in mind the order of layers in a neural network, as it affects the flow of information and the network's behavior during training and prediction.

 Here are some code examples demonstrating the usage of adding layers to neural networks and neurons to layers using the Neurons.me library:

## Adding Layers to a Neural Network:

```js
const neurons = require('neurons.me');
// Create a neural network
const network = new neurons.NeuralNetwork();
// Create layers
const layer1 = new neurons.Layer();
const layer2 = new neurons.Layer();
const layer3 = new neurons.Layer();
// Add layers to the neural network
network.addLayer(layer1);
network.addLayer(layer2);
network.addLayer(layer3);
```

## Adding Neurons to a Layer:

```js
const neurons = require('neurons.me');
// Create a layer
const layer = new neurons.Layer();
// Create neurons
const neuron1 = new neurons.Neuron();
const neuron2 = new neurons.Neuron();
const neuron3 = new neurons.Neuron();
// Add neurons to the layer
layer.addNeuron(neuron1);
layer.addNeuron(neuron2);
layer.addNeuron(neuron3);
```

## Iterating Over Layers of a Neural Network:

```js
javascriptCopy code
const neurons = require('neurons.me');
// Create a neural network
const network = new neurons.NeuralNetwork();
// Create layers
const layer1 = new neurons.Layer();
const layer2 = new neurons.Layer();
const layer3 = new neurons.Layer();
// Add layers to the neural network
network.addLayer(layer1);
network.addLayer(layer2);
network.addLayer(layer3);
// Iterate over layers
network.getLayers().forEach((layer, index) => {
  console.log(`Layer ${index + 1}:`);
  console.log(layer);
});
```

## Iterating Over Neurons of a Layer:

```js
javascriptCopy code
const neurons = require('neurons.me');
// Create a layer
const layer = new neurons.Layer();
// Create neurons
const neuron1 = new neurons.Neuron();
const neuron2 = new neurons.Neuron();
const neuron3 = new neurons.Neuron();
// Add neurons to the layer
layer.addNeuron(neuron1);
layer.addNeuron(neuron2);
layer.addNeuron(neuron3);
// Iterate over neurons
layer.getNeurons().forEach((neuron, id) => {
  console.log(`Neuron ${id}:`);
  console.log(neuron);
});
```

These examples demonstrate how to add layers to a neural network and neurons to a layer using the Neurons.me library. You can customize the number of layers and neurons according to your specific requirements. Additionally, you can perform iterations and modifications on the layers and neurons to achieve the desired network architecture and behavior.

### **Modules**

Once a module is loaded into a neuron, all of the module's properties and methods are available to that neuron, and can be accessed using the `getModule` method:

```js
const defactoModule = neuron3.getModule('defacto');
```

In this example, the `getModule` method is used to access the `defacto` module that was loaded into `neuron3`.

Modules provide a powerful way to extend the functionality of your neurons and tailor them to the specific needs of your project. You can create modules to handle specific tasks, encapsulate complex behaviors, or provide additional data and capabilities to your neurons.

Overall, the `neurons.me` library offers a convenient way to create and organize neurons, layers, and neural networks in Node.js, enabling you to build and experiment with different network architectures for various machine learning tasks.

 This model turns the traditional web model on its head. Users no longer depend on centralized authorities for identity or data management. They hold the keys (literally) to their identity and data. Services become more user-centric, providing services based on cryptographic proofs rather than centralized databases.

  While this approach offers many benefits, including enhanced privacy and user sovereignty, it's still nascent and requires a paradigm shift in development, deployment, and user education.
Side note:
 I'd sooner recode the Old and New Testaments, heck, throw in the Qabala too, in ASCII, before willingly plunging into the dull abyss of server-side user session management. Why swim in those murky waters when I can bask in the cryptographic labyrinth? Ditching the monotony of password management, I decided to champion a world where every individual becomes the keeper of their digital realms. Centralized authorities? More like relics of a bygone era. Here, you don't just own your identity; you seal it with cryptographic brilliance, untouched and ungoverned by any other. Crafting this cryptographic symphony may seem daunting, but compared to the tedium of server management?
