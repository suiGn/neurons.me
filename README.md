## Introduction to neurons.me

Learn more about the neurons.me ecosystem at: https://neurons.me

Welcome to neurons.me, a versatile and modular framework designed for the creation and management of neural network components. This framework serves as a cornerstone for building decentralized neural networks, offering developers the ability to define and orchestrate artificial neurons, neural networks, and layers with extensive customization options in JavaScript.

## Development Status

**In Active Development and Exploration**: neurons.me is currently in the experimental phase, with its features and core functionalities under continuous refinement. Given its developmental nature, aspects of the framework are subject to change. However, the foundational vision and its operational relationship with the [all.this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/all.this) library remain steadfast, aiming to provide a robust platform for neural network development and integration.

### Integration with all.this and i.mlearning

- **Seamless Connection**: Neurons.me is built to work in tandem with [all.this](https://neurons.me/all-this), leveraging its data structuring benefits to provide a robust foundation for neural network training and inference.
- **Collaboration with i.mlearning**: The library is designed to complement [i.mlearning](https://mlearning.studio/), an experimental module aimed at preparing and organizing data for efficient machine learning, particularly within the neurons.me framework.

By integrating neurons.me with these modules, developers can harness a unified approach to data processing, neural network construction, and machine learning, paving the way for innovative solutions in data analysis and interpretation.

For more detailed information and insights into the integration and capabilities of neurons.me, please visit [neurons.me](https://neurons.me/), [mlearning.studio](https://mlearning.studio/), and [neurons.me/all-this](https://neurons.me/all-this).

## Installation

Integrate neurons.me into your project with ease:

```bash
npm i neurons.me
```

## Basic Usage and all.this Integration

Begin using neurons.me and explore its integration with all.this:

```javascript
const neurons = require('neurons.me');

// Define neuron properties
let neuronOptions = {
  weights: [0.5, 0.3, 0.2],
  bias: 0.1,
  activationFunction: x => x * 2,
};

// Create and organize neurons into layers
let layer = new neurons.Layer();
let neuron = neurons.createNeuron(neuronOptions);
layer.addNeuron(neuron);

// Assemble neural networks and integrate with all.this data structures
let neuralNetwork = new neurons.NeuralNetwork();
neuralNetwork.addLayer(layer);

// Utilize the neural network within the all.this ecosystem for enhanced data processing and analysis
```

## Looking Forward

As we continue to develop neurons.me, our goal is to establish a transparent, adaptive, and impactful framework that not only stands on its own in the realm of neural network development but also complements and extends the functionalities within the all.this library. Stay connected for future updates and enhancements.

Engage with us, contribute, or raise issues as we collectively shape neurons.me to be an integral part of the neural network and data processing communities within the all.this ecosystem.
