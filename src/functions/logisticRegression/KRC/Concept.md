Understanding Logistic Regression

Concept and Origin

Logistic Regression is a statistical method that is used for binary classification tasks. Despite its name, it is not a regression algorithm but a classification algorithm. The name "logistic regression" comes from the logistic function, which it uses to model the probability of a binary outcome.

Why "Logistic"?
The logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function) is an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1. This is particularly useful for classification tasks where the output is a probability.

Logistic Function Formula:
𝜎(𝑥)=1/1+𝑒−𝑥
​ Where 
𝑒 is the base of the natural logarithm.

Why "Regression"?
Despite being used for classification, the model uses a regression approach to predict the probability of the default class. The output of the logistic function is interpreted as the probability that a given input point belongs to the default class.

The History
Origins in Statistics:
Logistic regression was developed in the field of statistics and was initially used for medical research. The logistic function itself was introduced by Pierre François Verhulst in the 19th century to describe population growth.

Application to Machine Learning:
Logistic regression gained prominence in machine learning due to its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification problems. It became especially popular for applications such as credit scoring, spam detection, and later for image recognition tasks.

Application to Image Recognition
Pixels and Image Classification:
In image recognition, logistic regression can be used to classify an image into one of two categories (e.g., cat or not-cat). Each pixel of an image is considered a feature. The logistic regression model learns the weights for these pixels (features) to predict the probability of the image being in one class.

Process:

Input: An image is converted into a vector of pixel values.
Weights: Each pixel value is multiplied by a corresponding weight.
Summation: The weighted pixel values are summed and passed through the logistic function.
Probability: The output is a probability value between 0 and 1.
Decision: A threshold (usually 0.5) is applied to decide the class.

Key Points:
Logistic Regression is used for binary classification.
The logistic function (sigmoid) maps any real number to a value between 0 and 1.
Despite its name, it is a classification algorithm.
It originated in statistics and is widely used in various fields, including machine learning for image recognition.
In image recognition, each pixel is treated as a feature, and the model learns weights to predict class probabilities.
Understanding logistic regression involves grasping how the logistic function is used to map inputs to probabilities and how the model is trained to minimize the difference between predicted probabilities and actual class labels using a cost function and gradient descent optimization.
