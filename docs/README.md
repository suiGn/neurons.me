## NEURONS.ME

-----------

### [Project Status : Experimental and Under Development, Subject to Major Changes]

The module is in active development, and as such, it is subject to significant changes as we refine our approach and methodologies to best support our goals.

----------

**Welcome to neurons.me,** a modular framework designed for the creation and management of **neural networks**. Offering developers the ability to define and orchestrate artificial neurons, neural networks, and layers with extensive customization options in JS.

## Installation

Integrate neurons.me into your project with ease:

```bash
npm i neurons.me
```

# Integrating With All.This

**neurons.me** is built to work in tandem with [all.this](https://neurons.me/all-this), leveraging its data structuring benefits to provide a foundation for **neural network** training and inference.

**Modularity and Independence**: By integrating **neurons.me** with these modules, developers can harness a unified approach to data processing, **neural network construction**, and machine learning.

**Please refer** to https://neurons.me to learn more about the whole ecosystem.









-------



## Looking Forward

As we continue to develop **neurons.me,** our goal is to establish a transparent, adaptive, and impactful framework that not only stands on its own in the realm of neural network development but also complements and extends the functionalities within the **all.this** library. Stay connected for future updates and enhancements.

Engage with us, contribute, or raise issues as we collectively shape **neurons.me** to be an integral part of the **neural network and data processing communities** within the **[all.this](https://www.neurons.me/all-this)** ecosystem.

# About All.This

## Modular Data Structures:

**[this.me](https://suign.github.io/this.me)  - [this.audio](https://suign.github.io/this.audio) - [this.text](https://suign.github.io/this.text) - [this.wallet](https://suign.github.io/this.wallet) - [this.img](https://suign.github.io/this.img) - [this.pixel](https://suign.github.io/Pixels) - [be.this](https://suign.github.io/be.this) - [this.DOM](https://suign.github.io/this.DOM) - [this.env](https://suign.github.io/this.env/) - [this.GUI](https://suign.github.io/this.GUI) - [this.be](https://suign.github.io/this.be) - [this.video](https://suign.github.io/this.video) - [this.atom](https://suign.github.io/this.atom) - [this.dictionaries](https://suign.github.io/this.dictionaries/)**

**Each module** in **[all.this](https://neurons.me/all-this)** represents a specific **datastructure**. These classes encapsulate the functionalities and **data specific to their domain.**

## **Utils**

**[all.this](https://neurons.me/all-this)** not only aggregates these modules but also provides utilities to facilitate the integration, management, and enhancement of these data structures. **For example:**

*The integration with [cleaker](https://suign.github.io/cleaker/) ensures each module instance has a **unique cryptographic identity**, enhancing security and data integrity.*
