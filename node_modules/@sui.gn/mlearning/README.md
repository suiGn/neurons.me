# mLearning
Machine Learning Tools.

mLearning is a proces to call invoked machine learning methods.
It stands by itself and can be attach to other process through the corresponding protocol.
In our official standing version (our online process): it inputs and outputs through netget.

Monads are both server && client and that's all they are.

## mLearning

A neurons computes a linear function z = Wx + b followed by an activation function.

The given code defines three random arrays: a, b, and c. Here is a breakdown of what each line does:

```python
python
Copy code
a = np.random.randn(3, 4)
This line creates a random array a of shape (3, 4) filled with random values drawn from a standard normal distribution.

python
Copy code
b = np.random.randn(1, 4)
This line creates a random array b of shape (1, 4) filled with random values drawn from a standard normal distribution.

python
Copy code
c = a + b
This line adds arrays a and b element-wise and assigns the result to array c. The addition is performed based on broadcasting rules, which allow arrays with different shapes to be added together.
```

In this case, since b has shape (1, 4) and a has shape (3, 4), the broadcasting rule expands the shape of b to match the shape of a. The resulting shape of c is (3, 4), and each element in c is the sum of the corresponding elements from a and b.



 Here's an example of a JavaScript array representing m = 3 examples with n = 5 features:

```
javascriptCopy code
const X = [
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],  // Example 1
  [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], // Example 2
  [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], // Example 3
];

console.log(X);
```

Therefore, after executing the code, c will be an array of shape (3, 4) containing the element-wise sum of a and b.
