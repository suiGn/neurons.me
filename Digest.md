The main steps for building a Neural Network are:

Define the model structure (such as number of input features)
Initialize the model's parameters
Loop:
Calculate current loss (forward propagation)
Calculate current gradient (backward propagation)
Update parameters (gradient descent)
You often build 1-3 separately and integrate them into one function we call model().
